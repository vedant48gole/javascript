//Variables-these are nothing but containers that stores data.
//The value of javascripts get changed during exeuction of program.
//Example- var a(we called it as identifier) = 7(value/litteral).
let a = 45;
console.log(45); //example of let using notr because of some bugs we donot use var instead of it we make use of let and const)


//.....................CONST:.........................//
//Note const is also same like variable which stores value but in case of l(let and var) we can change the value means who is particular developer value can be changed once is designed(modified) But in case of const we can't change the value.


//..................Example........................//
let x = "vedant"; //before const please declared value x.
const vedant = a; 
console.log(47);
